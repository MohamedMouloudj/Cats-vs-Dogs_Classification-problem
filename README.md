# Image Classification with CNN

This project demonstrates how I built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained to classify images of cats and dogs in contexte of a Kaggle competition by School of AI club.

## Project Structure

- `submission.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for splitting the dataset, data augmentation, and training the model.
- `upgrade.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the upgraded code that is in submission.ipynb, but I run it after the competition because of its long time training.
- `submission.csv`: CSV file containing the predictions for the test images.
- `test_petimages/`: Directory containing the test images. (Provided by SOAI)
- `train_petimages/`: Directory containing the train images. (Provided by SOAI)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
